# Tech Stacks Divide & Conquer
To help you get more experience with the idea of a tech stack and how different pieces of technology are selected and fit together to create a cohesive whole for a given project, we'll be doing a Divide & Conquer exercise.

## Instructions
In this Divide & Conquer exercise you will collaborate with your group to assign one or two particular technologies from the stack to each group member. Afterwards everyone will research their assigned technologies and try to learn the following:

* What role does the technology play in a tech stack?
* What interface does the technology present to other technologies that will interact with it?
* What constraints does the technology place on the rest of the stack?

#### Example: **PostgreSQL**
* Its role is to provide relational data storage.
* It presents an interface that uses the SQL language for communicating queries to, and data from, the database.
* One of the constraints it places on the rest of the stack is that it must be hosted on a server that is accessible to all other parts of the tech stack that will use the database.

#### Example: **Stripe**
* Its role is to provide a service for managing everything related to real-money payments.
* It presents a RESTful, JSON Web API for communicating with its external service.
* Stripe has a number of different SDKs which are designed to work for web, mobile, and other use cases. By its design the only constraint that Stripe places on your tech stack is that whatever device the user makes payments with must have access to the internet.

Once everyone has researched their assigned technologies, your group will come together again to discuss how each technology in the stack integrates with the other technologies and plan out how to present what is contained in the tech stack to the rest of the class.

## Example Tech Stacks
Below we present four different tech stacks for real-world applications. What we're presenting below is somewhere between the reality of the projects being hosted and an outside observer's hypothesis of what stack they are using. While each of these projects has a core piece that is open source most of them involve some proprietary software and/or hosting, which makes it difficult to say for certain what technologies are being used for that part of the stack.

### 1. [OneBusAway]() for iPhone
This tech stack includes the following components:
* [OneBusAway iPhone App]()
  * Swift
* [OneBusAway REST API]()
  *
* [OneBusAway Server]()
  *
* [OneBusAway Multi-Region Registry]()
  *
* []
* Transit agency providing static and real-time data
* Conversion of real-time data into appropriate data format

### 2. [F8 Conference App]()
