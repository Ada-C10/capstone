# Brainstorming

When thinking about potential capstone ideas, there are a few ways you can approach your brainstorm.

One way is to approach first with the concept in mind. This is an approach you'd use if you already have idea or a problem in mind that you want to solve. Oftentimes when you start with the concept, you'll want to use as much technology you _already know_ as possible, so as to get to the nitty gritty details of the problem you want to solve. This usually means using Rails for at least _some_ portion of your capstone project. When you approach your capstone concept-first, the most important thing to consider is MVP. If you have a really great idea, it's  easy to get carried away in attempting to implement more features than is reasonable within the time frame. Focusing on the minimum set of features you can implement is the best way to know if you can meaningfully solve this problem in the time allotted.

Another approach is to start with the technologies in mind. This approach is good if there isn't a specific idea or problem you want to solve, but rather you want to focus on technology as your primary learning goals. When you focus on diving deeper into existing technologies or learning brand new technologies, you need to have a smaller set of features than if you were to use a majority of technologies you already know.

With either approach, you must define your learning goals to ensure you stay on track with what it is you are trying to get out of this project. Identifying your MVP is important for both approaches, though it can be more important in maintaining a reasonable scope with the concept-first approach.
